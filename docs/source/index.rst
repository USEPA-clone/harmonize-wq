Overview
========

US EPA’s `Water Quality Portal (WQP) <https://www.waterqualitydata.us/>`_ aggregates water quality, biological, and physical data provided by many organizations and has become an essential resource with tools to query and retrieve data using `python <https://github.com/USGS-python/dataretrieval>`_ or `R <https://github.com/USGS-R/dataRetrieval>`_.
Given the variety of data and data originators, using the data in analysis often requires cleaning to ensure it meets required quality standards and wrangling to get it in a more analytic-ready format.
Recognizing the definition of analysis-ready varies depending on the analysis, the harmonize_wq package is intended to be a flexible water quality specific framework to help:

* Identify differences in data units (including speciation and basis)
* Identify differences in sampling or analytic methods
* Resolve data errors using transparent assumptions
* Transform data from long to wide format

Domain experts must decide what data meets their quality standards for data comparability and any thresholds for acceptance or rejection.
